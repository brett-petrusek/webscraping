Our mission is to reimagine how financial sponsors execute their investment thesis, from sourcing to exit, and maximize value to all stakeholders (financial sponsors comprise private equity firms, venture capitalists, family funds, and sovereign wealth funds). We seek to accomplish this mission through an industry-aligned operating model that optimally blends business domain knowledge, technology, and quantitative techniques.

Our core offerings include: (i) business intelligence applications, (ii) enterprise solutions that provide data science and operations research-driven insights to business users, and (iii) data science consulting.

Teragonia offers a comprehensive career development platform through cross-learning within our multidisciplinary structure. We nurture a diverse, inclusive, collaborative, respectful, and collegial environment. Our competitive compensation package aligns with industry leaders, encompassing 401k contribution matching, medical insurance, and additional benefits.

Division summary:

Teragonia’s Data Science and Operations Research (DS&OR) consulting division centers around the financial sponsor industry, given the important role the industry plays in fostering innovation and improving operating efficiency in the economy, while providing access to substantial private capital to startups and middle market companies. We specialize in leveraging innovative statistical, optimization, and AI/ML models to solve business problems and generate transformative business value.

We champion the professional growth and development of our team members, offering focused education, diverse professional experiences, and mentorship. We understand the importance of balancing between professional advancement and personal pursuits. Our team fosters a collaborative and forward-thinking environment.

Job summary:

The ideal candidate for this role will have a solid foundation in data science, mathematical modeling, and programming. You should have the ability to extract, summarize and articulate meaningful business insights to our financial sponsor clients. As a Senior Data Scientist at Teragonia, you will be a significant contributor to our service delivery, innovation, business development, practice development, and thought leadership. You will have the opportunity, and the management support, to develop specialized knowledge of data science and AI applications in a chosen industry or domain.

You will be passionate about learning the business applications of data science to enable revenue growth and cost optimization for our clients. You will develop and utilize expertise in technical research and review of existing solutions and literature relevant to the problem at hand.

As a Senior Data Scientist you should be able to write clean code efficiently, to develop advanced models. You will receive appropriate mentoring and have access to company selected resources and training programs to further develop your coding skills.

Service delivery - engagement and client management:

You will be working on multiple client engagements simultaneously, or a large and complex engagement, and the scope of the engagement could evolve based on changing client needs. The financial sponsor universe demands actionable insights in a relatively short period. As such, the engagement duration typically lasts a few weeks relative to longer-duration projects at large global corporations.

The engagement planning and status update meetings are critical to Teragonia’s innovation process and maintaining high quality standards and efficiency.

You will work closely with a cross-functional team of data scientists, business analysts and software engineers to research, ideate, develop and test scalable data science enterprise applications.

You will have the opportunity to assist the executive leadership and the officers with strategic marketing initiatives, including preparing marketing materials like pitch decks, case studies, and online marketing campaigns.

You will actively assist with conducting research for thought leadership initiatives, including publishing white papers and articles in peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and relevant domain-specific publications.

68,2023-04-28,PrescriberPoint,"AI Data Scientist, digital health start-up (Contract)",United States,"Description

BE AWARE OF FRAUD! All communications from us originate from Prescriberpoint.COM domain. PrescriberPoint does NOT request payments for interviews, or other financial transactions such as reimbursements, at any other point during the hiring process.

We are expanding our core talent and capabilities as we solve one of the healthcare industry's most vexing problems. On January 31, we announced investments from Lilly, Pfizer, Adobe and Mastercard to reimagine the traditional HCP-Pharmaceutical Company engagement model.

About PrescriberPoint:

PrescriberPoint’s mission is to revolutionize how HCP’s (Healthcare Practitioners; physicians and their staff) choose, manage and prescribe therapeutics for patients. Our vision is for a digital marketplace where HCP’s can access the support they need from all Pharma companies in one place. This is an industry primed for innovation. The addressable market of $35B includes 1M HCP’s and 4.5B prescriptions filled/year. Historically, drug companies relied on in person drug sales reps to conduct in person meetings to educate doctors. Those interactions have become less and less meaningful and COVID expedited the true end game, interactive digital engagement.

At the same time, the transition to digital engagement hasn’t met expectations; lacking unified customer experience, presenting fragmented data and resources, and cumbersome navigation. PrescriberPoint’s human centered design and cutting-edge technology created a core product with easy to use and consistent interfaces to branded products’ discovery and education, timely interaction with life science experts, patient co-pay and prior authorization support and more… all in a one-stop-shop. Our next generation pharma marketing platform will go beyond traditional consumer display advertising and use its traffic to engage HCPs in value-added, a la carte experiences that use first party and third-party data to allow pharma brands to engage HCPs on an on-demand basis.

We were incubated within Eli Lilly's Innovation Center in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group Digital Ventures.

Company summary:

Teragonia, a robustly capitalized startup with a well-established clientele, is dedicated to transforming the financial sponsor universe through cutting-edge data science and AI solutions. Our mission is to reimagine how financial sponsors execute their investment thesis, from sourcing to exit, and maximize value to all stakeholders (financial sponsors comprise private equity firms, venture capitalists, family funds, and sovereign wealth funds). We seek to accomplish this mission through an industry-aligned operating model that optimally blends business domain knowledge, technology, and quantitative techniques.

Our core offerings include: (i) business intelligence applications, (ii) enterprise solutions that provide data science and operations research-driven insights to business users, and (iii) data science consulting.

Teragonia offers a comprehensive career development platform through cross-learning within our multidisciplinary structure. We nurture a diverse, inclusive, collaborative, respectful, and collegial environment. Our competitive compensation package aligns with industry leaders, encompassing 401k contribution matching, medical insurance, and additional benefits.

Division summary:

Teragonia’s Data Science and Operations Research (DS&OR) consulting division centers around the financial sponsor industry, given the important role the industry plays in fostering innovation and improving operating efficiency in the economy, while providing access to substantial private capital to startups and middle market companies. We specialize in leveraging innovative statistical, optimization, and AI/ML models to solve business problems and generate transformative business value.

We champion the professional growth and development of our team members, offering focused education, diverse professional experiences, and mentorship. We understand the importance of balancing between professional advancement and personal pursuits. Our team fosters a collaborative and forward-thinking environment.

Job summary:

We are particularly interested in candidates who operate with integrity, intellectual humility, and a long-term career commitment. The ideal candidate for this role will have a solid foundation in data science, mathematical modeling, and programming. You should have the ability to extract, summarize and articulate meaningful business insights to our financial sponsor clients. As a Senior Data Scientist at Teragonia, you will be a significant contributor to our service delivery, innovation, business development, practice development, and thought leadership. You will have the opportunity, and the management support, to develop specialized knowledge of data science and AI applications in a chosen industry or domain.

Service delivery-technical skills:

As a Senior Data Scientist, you will work closely with our team that understands the client’s business needs and provide them with data-driven solutions. You will use statistical, operations research, and machine learning techniques to analyze data and develop predictive models while understanding the business context. The ideal candidate will have excellent attention to detailand the ability to work effectively as part of our diverse multidisciplinary team of business analysts, software engineers, financial engineers, and operations researchers.

You will be passionate about learning the business applications of data science to enable revenue growth and cost optimization for our clients. You will develop and utilize expertise in technical research and review of existing solutions and literature relevant to the problem at hand.

As a Senior Data Scientist you should be able to write clean code efficiently, to develop advanced models. You will receive appropriate mentoring and have access to company selected resources and training programs to further develop your coding skills.

Transforming low-hygiene data sets to develop organized databases with high fidelity is a necessary part of the job. As such, you will gain expertise in data wrangling skills. You will develop deep knowledge of the software tools used for service delivery, including data manipulation and data visualization software to efficiently and effectively complete the assigned tasks.

Service delivery - engagement and client management:

You will be working on multiple client engagements simultaneously, or a large and complex engagement, and the scope of the engagement could evolve based on changing client needs. The financial sponsor universe demands actionable insights in a relatively short period. As such, the engagement duration typically lasts a few weeks relative to longer-duration projects at large global corporations. The ideal candidate will be excited about working on a variety of topics in a fast-paced and dynamic environment.

The engagement planning and status update meetings are critical to Teragonia’s innovation process and maintaining high quality standards and efficiency. More importantly, they contribute to your professional development. You will actively participate in the engagement planning and brainstorming sessions by presenting your own ideas, asking questions, and challenging the ideas presented.

You will proactively manage your workload and the delivery timelines assigned to you, and provide status updates as requested by the engagement leader. Depending on your experience and specialization, you will have the opportunity to lead relatively low complex engagements with the support of the Lead Data Scientist or the Principal Data Scientist.

You will have strong communication and presentation skills and be able to clearly articulate to the team, and the client, the business applications and impact of the data science and quantitative concepts and principles relevant to the problem at hand.

Specialization:

You will develop specialized knowledge of data science and AI applications in a chosen industry or a domain (examples include, but not limited to, pricing, sales and marketing, supply chain, manufacturing, SaaS) or a combination of domain and industry that aligns with Teragonia’s strategic goals. Teragonia will provide appropriate resources to develop your knowledge in the tools and the chosen industry and domain.

Innovation:

Constant, purpose-led innovation is central to Teragonia’s success. You will work closely with a cross-functional team of data scientists, business analysts and software engineers to research, ideate, develop and test scalable data science enterprise applications. Innovating our processes to improve efficiency and novel solutions to our client’s business problems will be highly regarded by the executive leadership.

Practice development and thought leadership:

As a Senior Data Scientist, you will supervise, mentor and develop the junior data scientists both in an on-the-job and classroom settings. We operate on a “team-first” basis and your ability to mentor and develop the junior members is critical.

You will have the opportunity to assist the executive leadership and the officers with strategic marketing initiatives, including preparing marketing materials like pitch decks, case studies, and online marketing campaigns.

You will actively assist with conducting research for thought leadership initiatives, including publishing white papers and articles in peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and relevant domain-specific publications.

Initiative in coming up with effective training and development programs and practical new business development ideas, as well as identifying areas to pursue and publish our thought leadership based on your own research, will be highly regarded by the executive leadership.

DS & OR Flexible work policy:

We empower you to choose the work environment that best balances your personal needs with the business needs. We recognize that a remote location may allow you to better focus and balance your personal needs. We also believe brainstorming, planning, and team-building exercises are most effective in person and would expect you to be in the office, except when specific remote working arrangements are agreed due to personal situations.

For candidates living in the Chicago metropolitan area or New York City or within commutable distance, we expect your presence in the office based on business or team needs or team-building activities that are most productive in person. We do not impose specific days for in-office attendance.

We will consider specific remote working arrangements for candidates living outside the Chicago metropolitan area, New York City, or the adjacent suburbs to both cities. We ask that you travel to our headquarters for important events, such as critical brainstorming and planning sessions, training, or team-building events. If we open an office near you in the future, the same flexible work policy would apply as for our employees living in the Chicago metropolitan area or New York City, or within a commutable distance.

For more junior applicants ( less than 3 years of professional experience), we are looking for candidates living in, or willing to relocate to, within commutable distance of the Chicago metropolitan area or New York City so that we can provide you with the support and mentorship as you grow in your career. If you are willing to relocate to the Chicago metropolitan area, New York City, or within commutable distance, we will reimburse your reasonable relocation expenses.

83,2023-04-20,Chapter,Data Scientist,"New York, NY","Why We Exist

Every morning, 11,000 Americans wake up and begin their first day of retirement. While retirement should be an exciting, empowering, and fulfilling part of one's life, the reality today is that retirement brings along with it a fundamentally new set of challenges that make it an overwhelming time for many.

At Chapter, we believe that the current infrastructure for retirement is broken, and we're on a mission to fix it. We've started by building industry leading technology to solve the first major obstacle in retirement: navigating Medicare (healthcare coverage for retirees over 65). Our products help seniors sign up, choose an insurance plan, and leverage their plan after they are enrolled. And, unlike most Medicare advisors who only search plans that pay them, Chapter searches every Medicare option nationwide. This allows us to find savings and benefits that others miss.

But our ambition doesn't stop with Medicare — we seek to transform the way that Americans navigate and experience retirement. If this sounds exciting to you, we'd love to speak with you.

About The Role

We're looking for a Data Scientist to join the Data team at Chapter. You'll join a tight-knit team and be empowered to work closely with our product teams to help build out the future of analytics at Chapter.

How You'll Contribute To Our Mission

You'll be helping establish the foundation for data-driven decision making at Chapter, which includes problems like user segmentation, experimentation, engagement, retention and churn. This means collaborating closely with product managers and engineers to help them understand product performance across our various products, internal and external. Ultimately, you'll be part of a team that will focus on making sure that we deliver delightful customer experiences and improve the lives of the 11,000 Americans entering retirement every day.

Be a strategic partner for the business; identify areas of opportunity and work with cross functional teams to execute on them.
Work with stakeholders to define and calculate key metrics and make them available through dashboards and analyses and scale them up through automation
Build and maintain critical data sources related to product initiatives
Present learnings and insights in close collaboration with PMs to cross-functional teams
Be a close partner to product managers in impact sizing and prioritizing their roadmap


About You

5+ years of experience in analytics related field

Pull Systems helps electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, suppliers and operators manage their fleets with increasing levels of automation. Our software platform is underpinned by a library of machine learning models that predict battery behavior using a world class database of 3 years of operating history from nearly 100k vehicles. With Pull Systems, our manufacturer customers optimize costs (e.g., by predicting battery maintenance), boost aftersales revenues (e.g., by offering warranty extension products) and improve consumer experiences (e.g., by automating charging workflows).




Pull Systems is well-funded by some of the best-known investors in mobility, spun out of the Up Labs incubator in 2023 as the flagship company formed in partnership with Porsche.




Data Science at Pull Systems




At Pull Systems, data science is a core competency. It is at the center of our product, not just a tool to help executives make business decisions. The data science team is composed of motivated data scientists who work together as peers inventing, testing, and refining our core models for EV battery analysis. These models span analytics and discovery, statistical modeling, data mining, and machine learning.




As a small company of less than a dozen employees, every Pullitician–regardless of role–shares responsibility for a successful product. The data science team embodies this with a combination of individual and collaborative discovery, aligned very tightly with world-class data engineering and software engineering teams to solve end-to-end problems.

Experience working with engineering teams generalizing and integrating statistical models into software applications at scale, using standard engineering process and tools such as cloud platforms, source control, project management, and bug tracking
Expertise in Python or R and modern data science packages
Demonstrated ability to work independently on data science problems: designing, training, iterating, and validating your own models against loose directives set by management
Proven ability to communicate your methodologies and findings to a wide range of audiences from fellow scientists to company executives

Analyse Data Feeds
Build out daily, weekly, monthly reporting
And of course “Champion Data in the Business”!




But there is always a disconnect isn’t there. Because none of them actually get to the point and tell you what is really going on & what the role is really about.




Why? Because a lot of the time there is no point. Most of the time the company are thinking – “we got this massive data swamp we need someone to come and create some value from it”.




This Chief Data Scientist role is not like that.




Tech company in the delivery space, trying to completely disrupt it by dramatically lowering the cost of fulfilment by 30%. Those costs can then be past onto the Customer.




They can do this by ensuring that Delivery drivers are close to 100% utilisation. Currently delivery drivers on average spend a quarter of their day on dead time.




Building sophisticated Routing & Pricing optimisation algorithms are key to this. Make no mistake though, this is a race. A number of competitors are trying to do the same.




You’ll be tasked with leading & building a team to work on this. If successful it is likely the company, (already established $100,s millions turnover company) will be able to eat up huge marketshare as a fulfilment software provider to this global $500 billion dollar market.
