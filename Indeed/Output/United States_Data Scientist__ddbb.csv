Learning - Our data and AI products can span a range of applied AI focus areas. From NLP-based solutions to image recognition and processing, the applications are essentially unrestricted. Hence, this role will require an individual with an appetite for (quickly) learning and applying the various techniques needed to address the specific focus area
Communication - Ability to communicate effectively with cross-functional teams, engineers, partners and end-users. Excellent written and verbal communication skills to technical and non-technical audiences. Excellent technical writing and documentation skills
